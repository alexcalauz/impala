# Impala

Simple but powerful SCSS Framework
 - I developed it in 2012 and perfected over many years
 - In 2018 I have re-written it with SCSS

## Features
 - Powerful grids (Responsive)
 - Utility classes (Responsive)
 - Tons of settings
 - Components & Objects
 - Very configurable and sccalable


#### I have been using this framework for years in all sorts of projects but I have yet to write documentation for it.

## Enjoy
